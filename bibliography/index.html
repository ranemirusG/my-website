                <h2>The answer to: <em>"where did I get this idea from?"</em> or <em>"why did (or should) I read this?"</em></h2>
				
                <p>The opening credits of the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal%C3%B2,_or_the_120_Days_of_Sodom">Sal√≤ or the 120 Days of Sodom</a> include a section dedicated to its <em>bibliografia essenziale</em> that I've always found to be a practical idea, not in the sense of you-must-read-this-to-understand-me, but rather as a way to connect various ideas in a broader network, perhaps a true system.</p>

                    <img src="../images/pasolini-bibliografia-essenziale.png" alt="Pasolini's film opening credits with the bibliography of the following authors: Roland Barthes, Maurice Blanchot, Simone De Beauvoir, Pierre Klossowski and Philippe Sollers." style="width:80%;">

                <p>Then I saw Luke Smith's videos about bibliography formats, primarily for academic use, and so I decided to adapt these techniques to my <em>essential bibliography</em> use case. As <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he puts it:</a></p>

                <blockquote>
                <em>"I haven't read every book here, nor do I own all the books I've read or like. I also don't necessarily like all the books I own."</em>
                </blockquote>
				
				<p>I should add:</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>Every item of this section is here for a traceable reason. I have something to say about each one, even though I may not have read it. Needless to say, I'm open to both 1) suggestions and 2) discuss any of them with you. Just get in touch!</p>
                </blockquote>
				
                <p>In a way, this is part of the "dot files" of my mind configuration. I will also include other of media, such as films and artworks. Bear in mind that I'm sharing only the titles of each book entry; I usually have notes, tags, and links or exported Kindle highlights for each book, those I keep private for the most interesting use of this&mdash;I hope&mdash;lifelong project: to easily remap at any time a haphazard reading path; given that there are some periods when there is really very little logic to how I read (I try to think about this last thing more as a feature than as a bug) and here are also periods in which I don't read at all (that's healthy but it has some <em>continuity</em> issues, keeping with the cinematic slang).</p>
