                <p>The opening credits of the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal%C3%B2,_or_the_120_Days_of_Sodom">Sal√≤ or the 120 Days of Sodom</a> include a section dedicated to its <em>bibliografia essenziale</em> that I've always found to be a practical idea, not in the sense of you-must-read-this-to-understand-me, but rather as a way to connect various ideas in a broader network.</p>

                <p>Then I saw Luke Smith's videos about bibliography formats, primarily for academic use, and so I decided to adapt these techniques to my <em>essential bibliography</em> use case. As <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke Smith</a> puts it:</p>

                <blockquote>
                <em>"I haven't read every book here, nor do I own all the books I've read or like. I also don't necessarily like all the books I own."</em>
                </blockquote>

                <p>In a way, this is part of the "dot files" of my mind configuration. Other forms are included of media, such as films and artworks. Bear in mind that I'm sharing only the titles of each book entry; I usually have notes, tags, and links or exported Kindle highlights for each book, those I keep private for the most interesting use of this, I hope, lifelong project: to easily remap at any time<sup>[1]</sup> a very haphazard reading path; given that there are some periods when there is really very little logic to how I read (I try to think about this last thing more as a feature than as a bug) and here are also periods in which I don't read at all (that's healthy but it has some <em>continuity</em> issues, keeping with the cinematic slang).</p>
